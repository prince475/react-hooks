# React Hooks

Hooks are one of the programmatic react features. They are used to access different React features from your component.
This concept is also extended to React Dom where the React-dom contains specific Hooks for web application which run the browser DOM environment.
In this lesson we will examine and focus on the React Hooks

## Definition by Usage

Hooks allow a developer to use different React features from a given component. 

There are of two different types:

1. Built-in React Hooks
2. Custom React Hooks

## Built-in React Hooks

The built-in React Hooks can be categorized further by the different parts of the application they access as well as the use case.
Build-in React Hooks Categories are:

```txt
  - State Hooks
  - Context Hooks
  - Ref Hooks
  - Effect Hooks
  - Performance Hooks
  - Resource Hooks
```

## Custom React Hooks

Other than the built-in React Hooks, other times as a developer you might require a Hook for some more specific functionality: eg
fetching data, Keeping track of whether the user is online or offline in your application, or connecting to a chat-bot service.
Such hooks with these specific functionality might not be found in the Build-in React Hooks, but the good thing is that you can easily
create your own hooks to suit your application needs. That is where the term "Custom" derives from.
